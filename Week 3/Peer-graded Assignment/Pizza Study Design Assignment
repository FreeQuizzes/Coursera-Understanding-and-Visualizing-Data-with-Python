Pizza

For a Sunday the pizza shop may give some discount and ask customers who bought pizza on Sunday to fill a feed back form of the menu. We can collect review's from company's website. Using this data we can find some of most-loved pizza's of the shop. We can use those product's for our advertisement campaign. We can also look at negative reviews and see what customers did not liked from the menu and overall service. We can try to improve those products/services. We can also look at what class of people had visited the shop. If we find that rich people are more often visiting we can lower prices of some pizza's so that it becomes affordable to others.
